# Distributed Ledger Technology Hands On Lecture
**From theory to practice.**  
This lecture offers the chance to explore many key use cases of the Blockchain Technology as Distributed Ledger Technology.  
After your active participation you will be able to leverage your own creativity by prototyping key features enabling new business models.  

## Exploration Goals
### Create Your Own Currency
1. Implement a Smart Contract defining a crypto currency with a fixed supply of 2.000.000 coins - written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) extending an [ERC20 template](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)  
2. Deploy the Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain (ropsten test network)  
3. Transfer some of the coins to your friend  
4. Create a Liquidity Pool using [uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)  
5. Swap Tokens  

### Design a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation
1. Use the coins from the previous task as governance tokens via a decentralized / distributed App (DApp)     
2. Trigger an example poll  
3. To which extend would you compare a DAO with a classical stock corporation?   
4. Evaluate risks of governance token based DAOs like low voting participation, limited insights, education, expertise as a basis for decision making  
5. Consider approaches to [improve DAOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsoV1WpUYqc)   

### Create a Decentralized Volatility Farming Strategy
1. Understand how exploiting manipulation induced volatility at scale can contribute to a reasonable price stability  
2. Trigger some backtesting for your strategy    
3. Would you consider Decentralized Volatility Farming in the context of strategy consulting for banks? E.g. offering investment vehicles to Decentralized VoFarm Pools for interested, risk aware customers?   
4. Share your evaluations on Decentralized Volatility Farming in general  

### Create an Enterprise NFT 
1. Implement a Smart Contract defining an Enterprise NFT which contains a purchase right for a "physical world" asset of the enterprise - written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) extending an [ERC721 template](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)   
2. Deploy the Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain (ropsten test network)   
3. Trigger an auction   
4. Execute the purchase right and observe a corresponding status change of the Enterprise NFT  

### Review the Peer 2 Peer Enterprise Approach  
1. Explore how a decentralized Gig Economy might work - see also [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)  
2. Share your evaluations on such an approach 

### Optional: Debating Club 
1. Thesis: Banks shall invest at least 40 Percent of their R&D Budget exploring new business models & offerings based on distributed ledger technologies  
2. Antithesis: Banks should rather stick to their classical business increasing their efficiency within those fields & offerings

### Optional: Exchange on Bachelor Thesis 
1. Consider the content of previous tasks and the content of Mia's Bachelor Thesis  
2. What are the conclusions (synthesis) for you when it comes to strategy consulting for banks?

### Optional: Review a Decentralized Exchange Platform Approach
1. Explore how decentralized, hegelsche (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) exchange platforms could be designed  
2. Share your evaluations on such an approach 

### Optional: DLT Marketing, Education, Consulting
