# Distributed Ledger Technology Hands On Lecture

## Exploration Goals
### Create Your Own Currency
1. Implement a Smart Contract defining a crypto currency with a fixed supply of 2.000.000 coins - written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) extending an [ERC20 template](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)  
2. Deploy the Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain (ropsten test network)  
3. Transfer some of the coins to your friend  
4. Create a Liquidity Pool on [uniswap](https://uniswap.org/)  
5. Swap Tokens  

### Design a Decentralized Autonomous Organisation
1. Ensure the coins from the previous tasks can be used as governance tokens  
2. Trigger an example poll

### Create a Decentralized Volatility Farming Strategy
1. Understand how exploiting manipulation induced volatility can contribute to a reasonable price stability  
2. Trigger some backtesting for your strategy


### Create an Enterprise NFT 
1. Implement a Smart Contract defining an Enterprise NFT which contains a purchase right for a "physical world" asset of the enterprise - written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) extending an [ERC721 template](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)   
2. Deploy the Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain (ropsten test network)   
3. Trigger an auction   
4. Execute the purchase right and observe a corresponding status change of the Enterprise NFT
