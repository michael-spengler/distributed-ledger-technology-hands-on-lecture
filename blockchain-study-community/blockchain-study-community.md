# Blockchain Study Community
The **Blockchain Study Community** is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) which was inspired by [DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de/).  
Its goal is to connect business- & tech- enthusiasts to prototype valuable new business models and incentive systems by leveraging the Blockchain Technology as Distributed Ledger Technology.

## Currently on Hold 
Each Study Community needs at least one dedicated facilitator. Due to prioritization reasons we have put this topic on hold.  
As soon as there is strong demand with some dedicated time & budget for community facilitation, this topic will be reactivated.
