# Two Key Things to Understand

## Benefits of No Need For Centralized Institutions
High probability for fair systems to emerge - du to:    

### Simple Incentive Engineering  
It starts with consensys algorithms like Proof of Work (only reasonable as no decentralized Investment asset(s) exist) and Proof of Stake (e.g. coming with ETH 2.0).  
For smart contract developers it is easy to implement simple and fair incentive systems...  

### Freedom  
Everyone with free internet access can contribute to the decentralized web (web3)  

### No corruption      
If things are organized in a [real direct democracy](https://democracy.earth/), there is little till no possibility for making money by being corrupt  

### No propaganda    
Assuming propaganda is the intentional concealment of valuable perspectives or even the intentional distribution of fake news, decentralized news platforms - following the Hegel principle of **Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis** with community based governance - are the new standard, there is little till no possibility of propaganda.

### No Fake Democracy
As [direct democracy](https://democracy.earth/) becomes more and more simple to implement and maintain due to decentralization in general, it will be increasingly difficult to become and stay a dictator.  


## How did this Become Reality?
Within the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/blockchain-and-defi-basics/bitcoin%20whitepaper.pdf) we find a great orchestration of conceptual & technological inventions. This orchestration delivered many valuable answers - e.g. on how to reach consensys in da decentralized system in an efficient way  
With the introduction of the Ethereum Blockchain Vitalik Buterin and his homies brought this approach to a new level when he enabled us to not only store transactions in a distributed way but also programs --> Smart Contracts.
