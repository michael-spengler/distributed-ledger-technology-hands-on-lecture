# Two Key Things to Understand
Experiencing **benefits of decentralization** and **how this became reality** is key to get the point of the blockchain technology as distributed ledger technology.  

## Benefits of Decentralization
Decentralization improves the probability for fair systems to emerge - due to:    

### Freedom  
Everyone with free internet access can contribute to build and use the decentralized web (web3).  
Chances for "perfect markets" / "perfect competition"   (instead of oligopolistic markets) to emerge are high.  

### No Fake Democracy
As [direct democracies](https://democracy.earth/) become more and more simple to implement due to decentralization in general, it will be increasingly difficult to become and stay a dictator or a bunch of corrupt politicians.  

### No corruption      
If things are organized in a [direct democracy](https://democracy.earth/) (the power is rather with the people than with single politicians), there is little till no chance for making money by being corrupt  

### No propaganda    
Assuming propaganda is the intentional concealment of valuable perspectives or even the intentional distribution of fake news, decentralized news platforms - following the Hegel principle of **Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis** with community based governance - leave little to no chance for propaganda 

### Simple Incentive Engineering  
For smart contract developers it is easy to implement simple and fair incentive systems ...  


## How did this Become Reality?
Within the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/blockchain-and-defi-basics/bitcoin%20whitepaper.pdf) we find a great orchestration of (partly pretty old) conceptual & technological inventions. This orchestration collected and delivered many valuable answers - e.g. on how to [reach consensus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) in a decentralized system (consensus algorithms).    
With the introduction of the Ethereum Blockchain Vitalik Buterin and his homies brought this approach to a new level when he enabled us to not only store transactions in a distributed way but also programs --> Smart Contracts.    

To get the spirit, you might also explore [backgrounds on the genesis block](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/fun-facts/bitcoin-related-fun-facts.md) and on the cypherpunk movement.
