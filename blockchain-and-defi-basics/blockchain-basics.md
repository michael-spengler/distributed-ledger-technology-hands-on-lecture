# Two Key Things to Understand

## Benefits of No Need For Centralized Institutions
High probability for fair systems to emerge - du to:    

### Simple Incentive Engineering  
For smart contract developers it is easy to implement simple and fair incentive systems...  

### Freedom  
Everyone with free internet access can contribute to build the decentralized web (web3)   

### No corruption      
If things are organized in a [direct democracy](https://democracy.earth/) (the power is rather with the people than with single politicians), there is little till no possibility for making money by being corrupt  

### No propaganda    
Assuming propaganda is the intentional concealment of valuable perspectives or even the intentional distribution of fake news, decentralized news platforms - following the Hegel principle of **Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis** with community based governance - leave little to no possibility of propaganda.  

### No Fake Democracy
As [direct democracies](https://democracy.earth/) become more and more simple to implement and maintain due to decentralization in general, it will be increasingly difficult to become and stay a dictator.  


## How did this Become Reality?
Within the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/blockchain-and-defi-basics/bitcoin%20whitepaper.pdf) we find a great orchestration of conceptual & technological inventions. This orchestration delivered many valuable answers - e.g. on how to reach consensys in da decentralized system in an efficient way  
With the introduction of the Ethereum Blockchain Vitalik Buterin and his homies brought this approach to a new level when he enabled us to not only store transactions in a distributed way but also programs --> Smart Contracts.
