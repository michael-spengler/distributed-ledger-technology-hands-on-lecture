# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

Within this excurse we explore the evolution of [DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK5ypcAFA8A) Design - starting from basic features of the [daostack.io](https://alchemy.daostack.io/#) to [humanity based governance](https://app.proofofhumanity.id/) and to feedback loop based governance 

## Coin Based Governance 

## Humanity Based Governance
Check the intro on [Humanity Based Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HEGAeTtnko) and some early use cases like offering a [UBI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/universal-basic-income/)  

## Feedback Loop Based Governance
Ensure voters who voted for a decision which was bad, pay. Ensure voters who voted for a decision which was great, earn  

## Direct Democracy Approaches
Actively contribute to debating clubs to collect ups and downs for approaches like [democracy.earth](https://democracy.earth/)   
Visualize those ups and downs and come up with a reasonable synthesis    

Personal hint: To leverage debating clubs to a high extend, you might ask the contributors to do one round with intentionally changed roles (the ones with a "pro perspective" shall dive into the "con perspective" & vice versa)
