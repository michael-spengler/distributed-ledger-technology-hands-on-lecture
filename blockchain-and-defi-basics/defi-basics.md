## Banks Leveraging DeFi
Next to low-brainer approaches like offering crypto consulting and custodial wallets, there seem to be approaches which would rapidly improve the efficiency and fairness in the classical CeFi system   

Describe such approaches by including news like [these](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/) and protocol descriptions like [these](

## Influencing Momentum Towards or Away From DeFi
As the DeFi system seems to come with additional challenges like how to deal with crypto based money laundering, it also comes up with solution approaches to questionable actions of CeFi actors like 
the Gamestop related ["Robin Hood" Trading Halt](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/robinhood-faces-lawsuits-after-gamestop-trading-halt.html) or the [BaFin's Ban on Shortselling Wirecard](https://www.ft.com/content/75a94988-2dc4-4bb1-b65d-e744636504cd) influences DeFi Adoption

## DeFi Performance Indicators
### Total Value Locked (TVL)
In former times CeFi actors talked about **Assets Under Management** which is nowadays - mainly in the DeFi space - frequently called **Total Value Locked** because those assets / values are "locked" / invested in Smart Contracts / Protocols. It is a pretty valuable indicator as it shows where investors put their money.
