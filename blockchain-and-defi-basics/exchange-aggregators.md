# Exchange Aggregators
Exchange aggregators like [app.1inch.io/](https://app.1inch.io/) support the emergence of perfect markets where all supply and all demand is transparent and accessible vor everyone.  

They do so by taking all exchanges into the equation and choose the best offers to meet the customer's needs.  

Current challenges are "integrating" offers from exchanges across several chains (e.g. [ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/), [arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/), etc.).  

## Centralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges like [bybit](https://www.bybit.com/), Coinbase, [Uphold](https://www.uphold.com/), Binance are still frequently used as fiat on- / off-ramps. 
Their role as exchange platforms within the crypto space seems to vanish due to the rapidly improving decentralized exchanges.

## Decentralized Exchanges
Decentralized exchanges like [uniswap.org](https://uniswap.org/) seem to become increasingly attractive in terms of efficiency, accessibility and trust.
