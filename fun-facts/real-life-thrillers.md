# Real Life Thrillers
I consider it worthwhile exploring some of the recent real life thrillers playing out because the political sphere tries to mess around with the financial sphere :)

## DeFi Thrillers
It seems the only DeFi thrillers I know are caused by a lack of decentralization and with that by centralized actors who still had the power to manipulate things in their favour.  

The [Luna UST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CutSymg94I) Thriller   
The Manipulators Playing Newcomers out of the Space Thriller

## CePo (Centralized Politics) Thrillers
Julian Assange & Edward Snowden were dismantled because they fought for transparency, fairness and freedom    
Mainstream Media + most "social media" made politics instead of journalism and platform provisioning with decentralized content moderation    
Structurally installed opportunism gained power over pragmatic idealism    
Countries did business with system rivals - some of the money from this they used to buy military weapons with which soldiers from both sides were forced to kill each other - both sides believing the propaganda of their corresponding mainstream media
