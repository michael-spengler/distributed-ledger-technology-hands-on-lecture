# Real Life Thrillers
I consider it worthwhile exploring some of the recent real life thrillers playing out because the political sphere tries to mess around with the financial sphere :)

## CePo (Centralized Politics) Thrillers
Julian Assange & Edward Snowden were dismantled because they fought for transparency, fairness and freedom    
Mainstream Media + most "centralized social media" made politics instead of journalism and platform provisioning with decentralized content moderation    
Structurally installed opportunism gained power over pragmatic idealism    
Countries did business with system rivals - some of the money from this they used to buy military weapons with which soldiers from both sides were forced to kill each other - both sides believing the propaganda of their corresponding mainstream media
