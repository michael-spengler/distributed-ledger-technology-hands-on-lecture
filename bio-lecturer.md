# Bio & Philosophie Michael Spengler

I program for money, fairness & freedom.

To give you some background about my professional journey so far I mention some of my main stations.

maintenance & support responsiblilities

## SAP ABAP Consultant @okadis

customer specific enhancements in the context of loans- & assets management. 

## Programmer @SAP Banking & Tools

improving several internal and external tools & services like [chatbot services](https://cai.tools.sap/) etc.

## Lecturer for Web3 @several universities
Since 2019 I gradually shifted my focus towards being a Web3 (distributed web) programmer & Web3 Lecturer - e.g. at [DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de/).
In this respect I contribute to many open source projects - mainly in the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and in the [Deno](https://deno.land/) ecosystem. 


## Philosophie
### Questions I ask Myself
Do we enjoy the ride on our planet, in our solar system, in our galaxy - which seems to be one of [many](https://nineplanets.org/questions/how-many-galaxies-are-there-in-the-universe/) - as much as we can?   
Do we support each other as good as we can?  
Do we support fairness, health and freedom as good as we can?   

### Assumptions
Transactions of the weak should be private, transactions of the powerful should be public imo.  
Decentralization leads to fairer systems imo.
