## User Stories
As a company I would like to offer NFTs which e.g. represent a purchasing right for the owner. This might be useful for car manufacturers when it comes to offering a purchasing right for special editions to their most loyal clients.

As a loyal car collector I would like to buy a purchase right for a special edition to ensure I get one of my beloved models.
