# Decentralized Autonomous Organization

This project skeleton represents a distributed app which allows users to interact with a decentralized autonomous organization smart contract.

## How the frontend was created
After installing snel (see [prerequisites.md](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/prerequisites.md)), I executed the following command within the [decentralized-capital-pool folder]():  
```sh 
snel create frontend
```

## Start Locally
### Frontend
```sh
trex run start
```
