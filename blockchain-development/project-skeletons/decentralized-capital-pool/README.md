# Decentralized Capital Pool

This project skeleton represents a distributed app which allows you to deposit some Ether to a smart contract (serving as decentralized capital pool) and withdraw it again.

## How the frontend was created
After installing snel (see [prerequisites.md](https://github.com/michael-spengler/distributed-ledger-technology-hands-on-lecture/blob/main/prerequisites.md)), I executed the following command within the [decentralized-capital-pool folder]():  
```sh 
snel create frontend
```
